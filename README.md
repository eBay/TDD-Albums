Welcome! The TDD-Albums library started as a hands-on tutorial for a few iPhone developers at eBay that were interested in learning Test Driven Development. The goal of the library is to provide top-to-bottom lessons covering a variety of the topics a typical iPhone application developer would need while practicing TDD.

Our library covers topics familiar to iPhone developers, like networking and MVC, while working totally from TDD. Our library also introduces topics familiar to TDD developers, like dependency-injection and test-double classes, while working from Objective-C, Cocoa, and Swift.

TDD-Albums is appropriate for iPhone developers that have never attempted TDD. That being said, TDD-Albums is not appropriate for learning iPhone development. You must have strong competency in Objective-C and Cocoa before attempting this tutorial. You shouldÂ also have a working knowledge of Swift.

TDD-Albums is built from the Swift 1.2 syntax. This means that you should download the latest version of the developer tools. TDD-Albums builds correctly from Xcode Version 6.3 (6D570).
